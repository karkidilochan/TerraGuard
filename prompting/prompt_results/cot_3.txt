Let's think step by step. First, let's reason about the resources needed: this would be an AWS IAM group resource (aws_iam_group), and an AWS IAM group policy attachment resource (aws_iam_group_policy_attachment). Second, we fill in the attributes of each resource, starting with those explicitly and implicitly mentioned in the prompt, and followed by others: for example, for the aws_iam_group, we need to set the "name" attribute to a name. Finally, we connect the resources together, as needed: here "group" should be connected to the "aws_iam_group" resource, and "policy_arn" should be connected to the "aws_iam_policy" resource
```hcl
resource "aws_iam_group" "example" {
  name = "example-group"
}

resource "aws_iam_policy" "example" {
  name        = "example-policy"
  description = "A test policy"
  policy      = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action   = ["ec2:Describe*"]
        Effect   = "Allow"
        Resource = "*"
      },
    ]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_group_policy_attachment" "example" {
  group      = aws_iam_group.example.name
  policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.example.arn
}
```
