Let's think step by step. First, let's reason about the resources needed: this would be two AWS subnets (aws_subnet), two AWS instances (aws_instance), two AWS EBS volumes (aws_ebs_volume), an AWS VPC (aws_vpc), an internet gateway (aws_internet_gateway), a route table (aws_route_table), and a route table association (aws_route_table_association). Second, we fill in the attributes of each resource, starting with those explicitly and implicitly mentioned in the prompt, and followed by others: for example, for the aws_instance, we need to set the "instance_type" attribute to "t2.micro", and the "ami" attribute to the latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI. Finally, we connect the resources together, as needed: here the "subnet_id" of the aws_instance should be connected to the "id" of the aws_subnet, and the "volume_id" of the aws_volume_attachment should be connected to the "id" of the aws_ebs_volume.
