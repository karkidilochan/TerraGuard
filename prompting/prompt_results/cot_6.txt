Let's think step by step. First, let's reason about the resources needed: this would be two AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments (aws_elastic_beanstalk_environment), one in us-west-2 and one in eu-central-1, and Route53 resources (aws_route53_record, aws_route53_zone) to route traffic based on geolocation. Second, we fill in the attributes of each resource, starting with those explicitly and implicitly mentioned in the prompt, and followed by others. Finally, we connect the resources together, as needed: here the Route53 record should point to the Elastic Beanstalk environment's CNAME.
```hcl
# Configure the AWS Provider
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
  alias  = "us_west"
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-central-1"
  alias  = "eu_central"
}

# Data source to get the current AWS caller identity
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

# Create a Route53 zone
resource "aws_route53_zone" "primary" {
  name = "example.com" # Replace with your domain
}

# Elastic Beanstalk Application
resource "aws_elastic_beanstalk_application" "app" {
  name        = "my-app"
  description = "My Elastic Beanstalk Application"
}

# Elastic Beanstalk Environment in us-west-2
resource "aws_elastic_beanstalk_environment" "us_west" {
  name                = "us-west-env"
  application         = aws_elastic_beanstalk_application.app.name
  solution_stack_name = "64bit Amazon Linux 2023 v4.0.0 running Python 3.9" # Replace with a valid solution stack
  setting {
    namespace = "aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration"
    name      = "InstanceType"
    value     = "t2.micro"
  }
  opts = {
    provider = aws.us_west
  }
}

# Elastic Beanstalk Environment in eu-central-1
resource "aws_elastic_beanstalk_environment" "eu_central" {
  name                = "eu-central-env"
  application         = aws_elastic_beanstalk_application.app.name
  solution_stack_name = "64bit Amazon Linux 2023 v4.0.0 running Python 3.9" # Replace with a valid solution stack
  setting {
    namespace = "aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration"
    name      = "InstanceType"
    value     = "t2.micro"
  }
  opts = {
    provider = aws.eu_central
  }
}

# Route53 Record for us-west-2
resource "aws_route53_record" "us_west" {
  zone_id = aws_route53_zone.primary.zone_id
  name    = "www.example.com" # Replace with your subdomain
  type    = "CNAME"
  ttl     = "300"
  records = [aws_elastic_beanstalk_environment.us_west.cname]

  geolocation_routing_policy {
    country = "US" # Route US traffic to us-west-2
  }
}

# Route53 Record for eu-central-1
resource "aws_route53_record" "eu_central" {
  zone_id = aws_route53_zone.primary.zone_id
  name    = "www.example.com" # Replace with your subdomain
  type    = "CNAME"
  ttl     = "300"
  records = [aws_elastic_beanstalk_environment.eu_central.cname]

  geolocation_routing_policy {
    country = "DE" # Route German traffic to eu-central-1
  }
}
